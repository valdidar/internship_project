            <p class="vtext">The Birla Institute of Technology & Science, BITS Pilani is an all-India Institute for
                higher
                education. The primary motive of BITS is to "train young men and women able and eager to create and put
                into
                action such ideas, methods, techniques and information". The Institute is a dream come true of its
                founder
                late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close
                associate
                of the Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What started in
                early
                1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher education, ranging from the
                Humanities
                to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian
                University
                of International standing. This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and
                Science,
                Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.
                <br>
                Over the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over
                India
                admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found throughout the world in all areas of
                engineering,
                science and commerce. BITS symbolizes the maturing of Indian technical ability and "can-do"
                entrepreneurial
                spirit, especially as derived from the private sector. BITS is located in the Vidya Vihar campus
                adjacent to
                the town of Pilani in Rajasthan.

            <h5 class="vheading"><b>Our</b> vision</h5>
            <p class="vtext">Our commitment to transparency and stress on equal opportunity has been a key contributing
                factor behind our emergence as an institute of national repute, our rigorous intake process rewards only
                merit and ensures that only truly motivated students join us. Our curriculum is continuously being
                innovated
                and refreshed to reflect the latest developments in technology and trends within industry. Pure
                academics
                are supplemented by pervasive industry engagement and every student is exposed to practical applications

            <h5 class="vheading"><b>Our</b> policy</h5>
            <p class="vtext">The pursuit of excellence requires a transparent and honest approach. At BITS Pilani, we
                have
                always believed this to be true and are one of the few top institutes in India to favour a ‘Merit Only’
                based admission policy.
                <br>
                To ensure complete transparency in student intake in the undergraduate courses we have instituted
                BITSAT, a
                fully online exam. BITSAT tests students on their aptitude for Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.
                BITSAT
                also has a section on English and Logical reasoning, thus becoming a complete analysis of a candidate’s
                intelligence and capability.
