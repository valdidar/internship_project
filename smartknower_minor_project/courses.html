            <p class="vtext">Our B.Pharm. programme has been structured to match and exceed the requirements of the
                Pharmacy Council of India. The programme offers students additional courses which give the shape and
                flavour of engineering as well as fundamental sciences giving an added dimension to the studentâ€™s
                academics.

            <h5 class="vheading">M.Sc.</h5>
            <p class="vtext">These are integrated degree programmes without any intermediate B.Sc. degree. While these
                programmes ensure the required science component in any comparable postgraduate science degrees of other
                universities, they also incorporate many courses which have been notionally considered to be the domain
                of engineers. The integrated nature of the programmes and their analytical and engineering science
                contents give them a added professional character and equips students with the skills and problem
                solving abilities to participate usefully in industrial jobs. While a capable student with a 10+2
                background may be able to complete these programmes in four years, students with a 10+2+3 background
                with a B.Sc. degree, admitted on advanced standing basis will require two to three years to finish the
                programme. The vast majority of students who are admitted for these degrees also aspire and work for a
                second degree from B.E., M.M.S., B.Pharm. degrees under the dual degree scheme.</p>

            <h5 class="vheading">M.Sc(Tech)</h5>
            <p class="vtext">These programmes are multi-disciplinary, technological in character and are designed to
                meet the requirements of newly emerging professional activities. While these programmes are also science
                and technology based, their requirements of mathematics, science, applied science etc. will be different
                from B.E. (Hons.) and M.Sc. (Hons.). The areas which are currently incorporated in these degree
                programmes are Engineering Technology, Information Systems, Finance and General Studies.
                <br>
                The Engineering Technology programme gives students an exposure across all engineering disciplines and
                emphasizes knowledge of the operation of various technological units.
                <br>
                The programme on Information Systems equips students with comprehensive skills on computer software and
                software engineering techniques, both at the conceptual and application levels.
                <br>
                The Finance degree has been designed to meet the manpower needs due to the new thrust given to growth
                patterns in the economy. The courses planned for this programme meet the skill set requirements of
                financial institutions as well as financial management needs of any industry. The programme is
                complementary to the M.Sc.(Hons.) Economics programme and the MMS programme.
                <br>
                The General Studies programme does not have any specific discipline objective. However, the course is
                charted out in a way that candidates take humanities courses as well as certain general science and
                technology courses. Students sometimes also seek to acquire specific skills to meet varied career
                objectives by making planned use of electives and project oriented courses.

                dissertation stream may finish the programme in three semesters by starting work on the dissertation
                component in their first semester itself. The programmes are intended to give a immersive professional

            <h5 class="vheading">MBA</h5>
            <p class="vtext">Our management programme namely Master of Management Studies (MMS) has been designed with a
                difference and sets up a strong foundation in Science & Engineering. Based on feedback from industry, a
                new MBA programme has been formulated with input requirement as first degree of BITS or its equivalent.
                The programme will train and equip students with scientific and engineering approach to business
                administration. Students will also have a exposure to business critical modern technologies. The
                programme is designed to be flexible and have a very strong component of industry project experience.
                The programme is principally aimed at students already possessing an engineering degree. Students with
                other qualifications like B.Sc., B.A., B.Com. may also apply provided they have the requisite aptitude
                towards training in science, mathematics and technology. The requirements of the programme will
                necessitate such students to spend additional time which may vary from 1 to 4 semesters depending upon
                their qualifications. For students not having an engineering degree, the course requirement will be
                worked out, looking at the earlier training on a case-by-case basis at the time of admission.
